# Practical Exam: Grocery Store Sales

FoodYum is a grocery store chain that is based in the United States.

Food Yum sells items such as produce, meat, dairy, baked goods, snacks, and other household food staples.

As food costs rise, FoodYum wants to make sure it keeps stocking products in all categories that cover a range of prices to ensure they have stock for a broad range of customers. 

## Data

The data is available in the table `products`.

The dataset contains records of customers for their last full year of the loyalty program.
